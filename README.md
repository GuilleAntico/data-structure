Little class method that returns filtered names array based on two conditions

## Installation
 1. npm install

 1. npm run filter-function. you should see an array already sorted and filtered .
 
## Testing

# Notes
 I asked if an API was needed to return this data and the answer was no. 
 So i decided to implement a simple class that can be easily reused as a controller
 if an API is created. as a data structure i choose the file `structure.js`, again to keep it simple.
 But it can easily be turned in a Model connected to a database and it'll work as expected thou.
